# Fanflow AI

🏟️ Built Fanflow AI — a GenAI stadium operations and real-time fan routing platform for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

The problem: navigating mega-events is chaotic. Fans face unexpected bottlenecks, and staff lack real-time context. Fanflow AI reframes this by connecting live crowd telemetry to active incidents. It dynamically reroutes fans to less congested or ADA-compliant gates, while providing real-time intelligence for staff. Suddenly, crowd control is proactive, not reactive.

Under the hood: a React 19 + TypeScript SPA with Tailwind CSS v4, an Express backend, and full accessibility—including high-contrast themes and dedicated ADA routing modes.

The centerpiece is the Fan Concierge, powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash. It evaluates live stadium occupancy, auto-detects languages, and builds context-aware routing on an interactive SVG map. For staff, the AI automatically triages incident reports into actionable priorities.

Goal: make event navigation feel effortless, not overwhelming. ⚽

## Feature Breakdown by Target Persona

### Fan Features
- **Fan Concierge Chat**: A GenAI conversational assistant answering navigation, entry/exit, and transit queries. It auto-detects Spanish, French, and English, returning answers in the user's native tongue.
- **Interactive SVG Map**: Vector-based blueprint highlighting gates, zones, or transit hubs when referenced in the concierge's AI response. Zones dynamically change colors (emerald, amber, rose) based on live density telemetry, and the active stand automatically highlights the least congested zone.
- **Live Match Scoreboard & Celebrations**: Global synchronized scoreboard across all views that tracks live match progression, featuring rich UI pop-ups for goals and full-time celebrations complete with player cards and animations.
- **Accessibility Integration**: Accessibility (ADA) Mode alters visual themes (larger text, high-contrast colors) and forces the routing engine to bypass stairs and turnstiles, directing users exclusively to ramps and elevators (Gate 1 and Gate 3).

### Ops / Organizer / Volunteer Features
- **Dynamic Stadium Dashboard**: Evaluates overall stadium occupancy and average wait times in real-time. Automatically triggers critical Active Alerts if any stand exceeds 90% capacity.
- **Alert Level Triage**: Staff can monitor and manually adjust Alert Levels (Low, Elevated, High, Critical) across different zones to proactively manage congestion.
- **Sustainability Tracker Widget**: Computes dynamic carbon footprint savings in kilograms of CO2 and tracks public transit utilization metrics.
- **Real-Time Incident Reporting**: Form for volunteers and staff to log issues. The description is processed by Gemini to automatically assign priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH), categorize the issue, and create a one-sentence summary.
- **Operational Intelligence Feed**: Stream of active incidents sorted by priority. HIGH priority tickets trigger automatic density spikes in the DB, feeding back into the Fan Concierge's routing prompts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: `v20.x` or higher
- **npm**: `v10.x` or higher
- Optional: MongoDB Atlas Cluster URI and Gemini API Key. (If omitted, Fanflow runs on local mock fallbacks).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Fanflow
   ```
2. Install all monorepo dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```
3. Configure environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Edit `.env` to supply credentials if using live services:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_srv_uri_here
   ```

### Execution
Run both backend API server and Vite client concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Backend will run at: `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend will run at: `http://localhost:5173`

## Security Boundary & Simulation Boundaries

### Active Hardening Mitigations
- **Helmet Headers**: Secure HTTP headers applied globally.
- **CORS Boundaries**: Configured to whitelist designated development ports (`localhost:5173`, `localhost:5000`) and rejects wildcard origins in production environments.
- **Rate Limiters**: Standard global limitations with strict throttling dialed down on Gemini API routes to prevent API quota drain.
- **Oversized String Sanitization**: Requests containing payloads over 2000 characters for chat or 1000 characters for incidents are rejected before parsing to prevent buffer inflation.
- **Zero Log Leaks**: Logs are output in structured JSON. User input messages, names, and environment keys are never printed to stdout.

### Simulation vs. Production Scope
- **Crowd Telemetry**: Zone densities are powered by an in-memory background interval runner that applies simulated capacity jitter every 5 seconds, rather than connecting to live IoT camera feeds.
- **Database Fallback**: In the absence of a configured MongoDB cluster, the application automatically stands up an in-memory database instance to allow local testing.
- **AI Fallback**: If a Gemini API key is missing, the backend runs a deterministic pattern-matching engine that behaves identically to standard intent routing and incident categorizations.
- **Authentication**: Demonstrates role separation (Fan vs. Ops) using a simple client-side toggle to facilitate quick evaluation without OAuth databases.

## Known Limitations & Roadmap
- **Session Tracking**: Chat sessions rely on a single demo session ID. Production builds will require stateless JWT validation.
- **SVG Multi-Level Map**: SVG is currently a 2D macro projection. Adding layer toggles for multi-tier seating structures is planned.
- **Live WebSocket Feeds**: Telemetry currently uses 5-second polling. Upgrading to socket-based streams will reduce round-trip load.
